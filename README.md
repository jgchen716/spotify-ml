This project analyzed data gathered from the Spotify million playlist dataset found [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge).

Additionally, this project used the Spotify Web API and Spotipy to read in songsâ€”a large sample playlist, as well as each of our own collection of Liked Songs. Then, we applied k-means clustering using the audio features gathered from the API to create our own clusters, which would represent playlists generated based off similar audio features.
